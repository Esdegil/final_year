# final year project Vlad
# dev branch
## The plan is to merge dev to master once in a week with following notation vX.Y
### Y will be changed weekly and X should be changed with major updates such as finishing minimal requirements, etc.

## Instructions to run everything (in case I forget)
After finishing changes to the image do (from root dir in terminal)
``` idf.py build 
	idf.py flash monitor
```
Note: if flahs monitor doesn't work because of missing serial - check cable OR do `sudo chmod -R 777 /dev/ttyUSB0` \
// TODO: Change these terminal instructions to be something faster usable.
